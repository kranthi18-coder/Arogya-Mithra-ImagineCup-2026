# 🏥 Arogya Mithra  
Microsoft Imagine Cup 2026 – Team SASTRA Innovators  

Arogya Mithra is an AI-powered health assistance concept designed for Microsoft Imagine Cup 2026.  

The idea focuses on helping rural and elderly users who struggle with medication reminders, hospital access, language barriers, and understanding health guidance.

The application allows users to interact through voice or text in multiple languages. Based on their input, the system suggests nearby hospitals, provides simple health and lifestyle guidance, reminds them to take medicines on time, and shares information about relevant government healthcare schemes like PMJAY and Ayushman Bharat.

This project was designed using Microsoft Azure AI architecture, including Azure Speech Services, Azure Language Service, Azure Text Analytics, Azure OpenAI, and Azure Content Moderator.  

We also focused strongly on Responsible AI principles such as safety, transparency, privacy, and accessibility.

This repository presents the project idea, architecture design, and demo prepared for Imagine Cup 2026. It represents a prototype concept and system design, not a full production medical application.
